        <p>Thank you for visiting my page. I have a bachelor’s degree in merchandising and business from Ohio State University. 
            Right out of college, I started a consignment shop in my hometown of Cleveland. I created the store’s website and 
            tied it to the Access database that my point of sales software ran on so that customers could check to see if their 
            items had sold. I ran it for five years and sold the growing business in 2010 when I made the decision to move to 
            Seattle. It’s still a successful business today! 
        </p>
        <p>
            I’ve always been very interested in understanding how software, websites, and databases work behind the scenes and 
            utilizing that to make experiences more streamlined. I have a lot of experience working with small businesses to 
            improve processes. For example, I worked at an independent clothing store in Seattle for several years and was able 
            to create a simple program that tied a check template to an existing Google spreadsheet and vastly cut down on the 
            time it took to print checks.
        </p>
        <p>
            I’m currently working as an administrative assistant in the UW Psychiatry department. Even in this role, my 
            supervisors discovered my interest in technology and web-development and assigned 40% of my time in a communications 
            technology role, updating and maintain the department website in SharePoint, using HTML. I also create all 
            department e-mail templates using HTML. I’m currently seeking a web-development job. Please use the contact 
            form if you’d like more information.
